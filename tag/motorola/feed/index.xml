				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a Moto X Pure Edition which I bought at the end of last year as a last minute replacement to my LG G4, which was poorly manufactured, and conveniently just out of warranty. Of the phones that were available to buy that day in Best Buy, the Moto X was the best option, but not necessarily a great option.</p>
<p>In my mind, Motorola had a reputation for keeping their phones up to date.  I had also heard that they made it easy to unlock your bootloader, even providing official instructions on how to do it.  Well, once you own one of their phones, your view on those things changes.  When I took the phone out of the box, it was on Android 5 Lollipop, but there was an update waiting, and I did that.  Now the phone was on Android 6 Marshmallow.  People kept posting online saying that the update to Android 7 Nougat was just around the corner.  To this day, that update has never arrived officially from Motorola.  And worse than that, the security patches are only up to December 2016.</p>
<p>Thinking that the update was just around the corner, I avoided unlocking the bootloader and installing Lineage OS (the replacement for CyanogenMod, which has had Android 7 available on the Moto X for a while now).  I would have just done it, but Motorola has a catch to providing the bootloader unlock code that people don&#8217;t tell you about, it voids the warranty.  Not just in the sense that they won&#8217;t fix anything stupid you do to the software under warranty, obtaining the code literally puts you in a database for no warranty work.  Given my bad experience with the LG G4 which failed by way of the same chipset that was in the Moto X, I wanted the warranty in force for as long as possible.  But recent Android security concerns changed my stance on this.  I went and got the unlock code and installed Lineage OS.  Even though they don&#8217;t offer a stable build yet, I&#8217;ve found it to have less bugs than the software that Motorola provided.</p>
<p>But wait, there&#8217;s more.  Whenever I start up the phone, it displays an obnoxious message about the bootloader being unlocked.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/neilwilcoxson.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MotoXNexusBootComp.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-315" src="https://i0.wp.com/neilwilcoxson.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MotoXNexusBootComp.jpg?resize=860%2C574" alt="" width="860" height="574" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neilwilcoxson.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MotoXNexusBootComp.jpg?resize=1024%2C683 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/neilwilcoxson.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MotoXNexusBootComp.jpg?resize=300%2C200 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neilwilcoxson.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MotoXNexusBootComp.jpg?resize=768%2C512 768w, https://i0.wp.com/neilwilcoxson.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MotoXNexusBootComp.jpg?w=1720 1720w, https://i0.wp.com/neilwilcoxson.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MotoXNexusBootComp.jpg?w=2580 2580w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>On the right is my Nexus 5 with a tasteful warning that the bootloader has been unlocked.  On the left is my Moto X telling you that using this device might injure people.  There is a way to replace this message with something else, but I think I&#8217;ll just leave it so I can have a good laugh at the expense of Motorola every time I restart my phone.</p>
<p>So the answer to the question: Will the Moto X ever get updated?  Officially no, but you can make it happen if you&#8217;re out of warranty or don&#8217;t mind voiding it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Due to a recent failure of my LG G4, I had to quickly search for a new phone.  Whether or not it&#8217;s the best phone for me, I&#8217;ve landed with the Moto X Pure Edition.  It&#8217;s fits what I needed better than most Android phones, but I would&#8217;ve preferred that my G4 keep working.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my YouTube video where I discuss the important aspects of the phone in more detail:<br />

<p>As always, I appreciate suggestions for anything you&#8217;d like to see me write or make a video about.  You can use the YouTube comments, or the comments on this page.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunately I don&#8217;t have time to make a well produced video sharing all of the details of my situation. However, I would like to share some details about what has happened lately, because I feel like the video I posted a few weeks ago left the whole thing a little open ended.</p>
<p>First, a refresh about what happened.  I was going about my day as I normally would, and while using it, my phone shut off.  The bootloader screen came up, but got stuck.  I attempted several restarts and got the phone all the way booted several times, but could never stay on for more than five minutes or so.  I thought it was a software problem, and reflashed the ROM, but I had no luck.  Upon further research, I found out that this was happening as a result of a hardware fault, which the internet had known about since the beginning of the year.  Unfortunately, my phone outlasted the one year warranty, and I ended up having to get a new phone.  This is where I left off at the end of the video I posted.  If you&#8217;re interested in seeing me explain it in the moment you can watch the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRVwj5TNfBQ">here.</a></p>
<p>Another frustrating aspect to the whole situation is that I had the phone leased on Jump on Demand (through T-Mobile).  I had three months remaining, and then I was planning on paying off the phone and keeping it because I liked it&#8217;s features, as I mentioned in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VPeswyxF5Q">Finding a Long Lasting Phone video</a>.  This wasn&#8217;t going to be possible.</p>
<p>The phone I ended getting a Moto X.  I would have liked to get a phone that I could add an extended battery to, but there aren&#8217;t very many of those out there, and at this point they are mostly very low end phones.  Most standard phone batteries cannot make it through the day with my usage, and the Moto X is no exception.  Now I have to work out a mobile charging solution, which is inconvenient, but I can manage.  If it was the case that I couldn&#8217;t get an extended battery, I might have considered a phone from OnePlus, but I needed something I could get quick, and all of the OnePlus phones were backordered at the time.  Ultimately I&#8217;m okay with this selection because the Moto X has pretty much the same specs are the LG G4.  The Moto X also has a purer version of Android, one of my main complaints about the G4.</p>
<p>At some point I&#8217;ll be sure to make a video detailing my impressions.  However, I will be waiting a while, because there are already plenty of videos from people who have used the phone for about a week.  I&#8217;d rather discuss aspects of the phone that will impact the long term.  I&#8217;ll also have to discuss the fact that to get the unlock code for the bootloader, you have to agree to void the warranty, something that I don&#8217;t want to do, considering what happened to my last phone.  So yes, I&#8217;ll be running on non-rooted Android for a while.</p>
<p>In summary, this whole thing sucks, and I would have been perfectly happy keeping my LG G4.</p>
