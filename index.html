        Welcome to my creation.
        You may notice that this site looks very different than it has in years past.
        You would be right.
        What was once an easily templated, expensive to host, Wordpress site has become a simple set of statically linked pages with questionable design decisions.
        Right now you'll still see the old Wordpress stuff on some of the blog posts.
        Seeing as this is a side project, I'll try to fix that when I have time.

        <br><br>If you have no idea what I'm talking about, then you've never been to the old site.
        In that case I would have to ask, how did you get here?
        Perhaps you Googled my name, or arrived out of curiosity from the domain name in my email address.
        I don't really need to know, but I'm glad you're interested in me as a person.

        <br><br>-Neil Wilcoxson
