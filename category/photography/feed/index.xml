				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In case you&#8217;re one of the last people who hasn&#8217;t found out yet, I spent my &#8220;winter&#8221; break in Australia.  The good news was it was actually summer, and the weather was quite nice.  I enjoyed my time there, and I have good friends to thank for that.  I&#8217;m not a huge fan of sharing my personal vacation photos on the internet, nor do I think many people would be interested in them.  However, I thought it would be good to share the photos that I uploaded to 500px, and talk a little bit more about how I shot them, and what I was thinking at the time.  All photos will have the context below the photo it refers to.</p>
<div class="pixels-photo">
<p><img src="https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/193382665/m%3D900/691bf089223443caad14cf0352612856" alt="Opera House at Night by Neil Wilcoxson on 500px.com" /></p>
<p>I would consider this photo one of my favorites.  I&#8217;ve even set it as my desktop background.  This is a long exposure, although if I were to take it again I think I&#8217;d try to get a longer exposure.  This one was only 15 seconds.  Unfortunately the only camera I have anymore is a Micro 4/3, which isn&#8217;t nearly as good at low light as the Canon cameras I used to have.</p>
<div class="pixels-photo">
<p><img src="https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/193382685/m%3D900/f568682a17f6d0985b65cec47bda97f6" alt="Harbour Bridge at Night by Neil Wilcoxson on 500px.com" /></p>
</div>
<p>This is another photo I took the same night.  If this isn&#8217;t a landmark you recognize, the subject is the Sydney Harbour Bridge.  This one was handheld, and I used my 20mm pancake lens.  I am impressed with nearly every photo I take will this lens.  The dots you see above the bridge are birds, and unfortunately not stars.</p>
</div>
<div class="pixels-photo">
<p><img src="https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/193382663/m%3D900/3338444eb242079e0df3f44952a637b8" alt="Flags by Neil Wilcoxson on 500px.com" /></p>
<p>For whatever reason I really enjoy taking pictures of flags.  They are a challenge to capture, but not nearly as difficult to capture as animals.  In this photo they&#8217;ve caught the wind quite well, and are flying in the optimal direction.</p>
</div>
<div class="pixels-photo">
<p><img src="https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/193382661/m%3D900/8b09a097e364c7eed5fe9e5d684bb125" alt="Sydney Harbour by Neil Wilcoxson on 500px.com" /></p>
<p>This one was challenging to edit the exposure on, and I&#8217;m still not entirely sure that I have it how I like it.  I think this photo really benefited from the polarizer filter that I used.</p>
</div>
<div class="pixels-photo">
<p><img src="https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/193382701/m%3D900/3a8129319d0bc4d12fc9644e928af6ed" alt="Not Paris by Neil Wilcoxson on 500px.com" /></p>
<p>This one is on the Harbour Bridge.  Someone has tried to start something like they have in Paris, and a few others have played along.  The framed the Opera House nicely from my perspective.</p>
</div>
<div class="pixels-photo">
<p><img src="https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/193382703/m%3D900/3d8f40bad839c52a34674b4184985b8f" alt="Harbour Bridge by Neil Wilcoxson on 500px.com" /></p>
<p>Probably one of my favorite spots that I visited in Sydney was the Observatory Hill Park.  Walking around you could get a nice view in most directions, including of the Harbour Bridge.</p>
</div>
<div class="pixels-photo">
<p><img src="https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/193382631/m%3D900/5e3ae8400d24aaa80475adba64274ad2" alt="What" /></p>
<p>This one would be interesting for some sort of contest where you have to guess where in the world this is.  It should be pretty easy to identify, but perhaps the viewer doesn&#8217;t look where I&#8217;m looking.</p>

<p>This one is from Taronga Zoo in Sydney.  I&#8217;m not that great at photographing animals, but this one managed to turn out alright.</p>

<p>This photo was taken on the roof of Parliament House is Canberra.  Yes, they will let pretty much anyone on the roof.</p>

<p>This is Boroka Lookout near Halls Gap in Victoria.  It&#8217;s a good view, and from one of the days I enjoyed most on my trip.</p>

<p>I went ahead and threw in one of my personal photos anyway.  This is at MacKenzie Falls, also near Halls Gap.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First, let’s put my opinion in perspective.  The first interchangeable lens camera that I used was a Canon REBEL T1i.  I later upgraded to a T4i, mostly for video features.  After deciding that my Canon setup occupied to much space for a trip that I was taking, I decided to look into smaller options.  I went with an older model Micro 4/3 camera, the Panasonic GX7.  I kept both systems around for a while, and used each one when it was appropriate.  However, since I had college just around the corner, I didn’t see myself having time to fully utilize two camera systems.  After a while I realized that the longer I waited to sell one of them, the more it would depreciate, so I elected to sell my Canon system, which I had owned for longer.  I decided that I could always buy a much nicer system once I graduated, and having no leftovers would allow me to make a decision based on which was the best, not based on what gear I already owned.  Having decided to use Micro 4/3 for now, I thought I’d share some Pros and Cons of the system to help you make your decision.</p>
<h2>Pros</h2>
<h3>Smaller equipment size</h3>
<p>This was the primary reason why I chose Micro 4/3.  As I mentioned previous, I take a lot of photos while travelling.  For certain trips, I just couldn’t bring a huge camera system.  With my GX7, I do not need a dedicated camera bag.  I can toss everything I need into whatever bag I’d be carrying anyway.</p>
<h3>Many manufacturers making compatible lenses</h3>
<p>Even though I haven’t made heavy use of this feature, it is worth mentioning.  It will probably be most useful when it comes time to get a new camera body.  I like knowing I can keep my current lenses even if I choose a different manufacturer.</p>
<h3>Lenses from other systems more easily adapted</h3>
<p>This comes down to sensor size.  Any lenses designed for a sensor at or lower than the size of Micro 4/3 can be adapted with a passive adapter.  This is quite popular, and many adapters are available for cheap.  I don’t have any experience with these other than being aware of their existence.</p>
<h3>Good for video</h3>
<p>Even if still photo quality can’t quite match bigger sensors, video is lower resolution, and the difference isn’t as noticeable.  I now shoot most of my YouTube videos with my GX7, and in most cases the quality is the same or better than the Canon system I used before.  There are also more video oriented cameras like the GH4.  Some Blackmagic cameras (which are dedicated to video) also use Micro 4/3 lenses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The smaller sensor also has a deeper depth of field.  This refers to the range of distances from the lens that are in focus.  This does make it harder to get blurry backgrounds, but it makes the camera’s autofocus more reliable.  Depending on the situation, I can actually use it for video, whereas Canon’s system was never good enough for my tastes.</p>
<h3>Less professional looking</h3>
<p>Especially when you’re traveling in unfamiliar places, the last thing you want is to stick out.  When you use a camera with the DSLR body style, people automatically associate it with what the pros use, and assume it is expensive.  My GX7 (especially with smaller lenses attached) makes people think I’m holding an older point and shoot.</p>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<h3>Low light performance</h3>
<p>This is the biggest drawback for me.  When shooting on my Canon system, I discovered that ISOs of up to 1600 would look clean, and 3200 would be okay depending on the situation.  This is not the case with Micro 4/3.  Of course, technology is getting better all the time, but with my GX7, the highest I really want to go is ISO 800.  Beyond that, noise starts getting introduced to the image.</p>
<h3>Less professional looking</h3>
<p>I know I previously said that this can be a pro, but it can also be a con.  If someone is paying you to be a photographer, you don’t want them thinking you’re using cheap equipment.  Of course, you and I know that Micro 4/3 systems aren’t cheap, but they’re just going off looks.  This also depends a lot on the camera you’re using.  A GH4 has a pretty large body and shouldn’t cause many problems.</p>
<h3>More expensive</h3>
<p>Even though I bought an older model camera, it still didn’t come cheap.  To get my GX7, a 14-140 zoom, and 20mm prime, I paid nearly $2000.  Prices change all the time, so I can’t say exactly what you’ll pay, but be prepared to pay more for camera bodies and lenses.  If you’re up for experimentation, you can consider adapting older lenses, which can be found cheap online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully my experience has helped.  Let me know if there’s any more information I can provide that would be helpful.  I’ll consider making a YouTube video on this topic if there is enough demand.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This weekend being a three-day weekend, I had some extra time, and was able to go out and take some photos.  This time I chose the suspension bridge because it was close, but I have a few other places in mind.  Nonetheless, I really enjoyed it, and I hope I&#8217;ll find more time to go out real soon.  I&#8217;ve chosen some of my best results, and placed them below.  If you&#8217;d prefer you can view the gallery directly on <a href="https://500px.com/neilwilcoxson/galleries/waco-suspension-bridge">500px.</a></p>
